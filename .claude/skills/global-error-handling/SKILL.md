name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages, proper exception types, and graceful degradation patterns. Use this skill when adding try-catch blocks, creating error boundaries, handling API errors, or implementing retry logic. Apply when validating input, catching exceptions, displaying error states to users, or logging errors for debugging.

## When to use this skill:

- When adding try-catch blocks or error boundaries
- When handling API response errors
- When implementing user-friendly error messages
- When creating custom error types or exception classes
- When implementing retry logic with exponential backoff
- When designing graceful degradation for failed services
- When logging errors for debugging and monitoring
- When validating preconditions at function entry points
- When cleaning up resources in finally blocks
- When handling async/await errors
- When implementing global error handlers in APIs
