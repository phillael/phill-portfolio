# Product Mission

## Pitch

**Phill Aelony's Developer Portfolio** is an interactive, cyberpunk-themed web experience that helps recruiters, companies, and fellow developers discover a senior full stack engineer's work and personality by providing a visually stunning, accessible, and genuinely fun alternative to the traditional resume.

This is not a CV. This is a digital artifact that proves what Phill can build.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **Recruiters & Hiring Managers:** Decision-makers evaluating Phill for engineering roles who need to quickly assess skills, experience, and culture fit
- **Engineering Teams:** Technical peers reviewing the portfolio to gauge code quality, creativity, and technical depth
- **Industry Connections:** Fellow developers, collaborators, and friends exploring Phill's work and creative projects

### User Personas

**The Time-Strapped Recruiter** (30-50)
- **Role:** Technical Recruiter or Hiring Manager
- **Context:** Reviewing dozens of candidates for senior engineering positions
- **Pain Points:** Portfolio sites all look the same; hard to gauge personality and culture fit from a PDF
- **Goals:** Quickly understand candidate's skills, see real work, get a sense of who they are as a person

**The Curious Engineer** (25-40)
- **Role:** Fellow Developer or Potential Collaborator
- **Context:** Discovered Phill through a project, conference, or referral
- **Pain Points:** Most portfolios are boring static pages that don't demonstrate actual frontend skills
- **Goals:** See impressive technical work, explore code quality, maybe find inspiration

**The Six-Year-Old Niece** (6)
- **Role:** Family member and unofficial UX tester
- **Context:** Just wants to play with something fun on Uncle Phill's website
- **Pain Points:** Boring websites with too much text
- **Goals:** Click things that explode, hear cool sounds, see pretty animations

## The Problem

### Developer Portfolios Are Forgettable

Most developer portfolios are sterile, template-driven pages that fail to differentiate candidates. Recruiters see hundreds of identical Bootstrap sites with the same project cards and skill bars. The result: talented engineers blend into the noise.

**Our Solution:** Build a portfolio that is itself a demonstration of skill. Every interaction, animation, and visual element proves technical capability while revealing personality. The site should be so engaging that visitors remember it weeks later.

## Differentiators

### A Resume You Actually Want to Explore

Unlike traditional portfolio templates, this site transforms the resume into an interactive experience with cyberpunk aesthetics, custom animations, and delightful surprises. Visitors don't just read about Phill's skills--they experience them firsthand through the craftsmanship of the site itself.

### Music Meets Code

Unlike other developer portfolios, this site showcases Phill's dual identity as both engineer and composer. Original music with real-time audio visualizations demonstrates the rare intersection of technical skill and artistic creativity. Not many engineers can say they composed music for an award-winning game with $7.1M in revenue.

### Accessibility as a Feature, Not an Afterthought

Unlike sites that treat accessibility as a checkbox, this portfolio is built from the ground up with WCAG compliance. Phill achieved a perfect VPAT score professionally--this site will demonstrate that same commitment. Beautiful and accessible are not mutually exclusive.
