# Phase 3: Polish & Interactivity - Raw Idea

Phase 3 focuses on Polish & Interactivity for the cyberpunk developer portfolio. This phase includes:

1. Downloadable Resume - PDF resume download functionality with print-friendly design matching site branding
2. Micro-Interactions - Hover effects, click animations ("things that explode"), scroll-triggered reveals
3. Contact Section - Social links, email, optional contact form with cyberpunk styling
4. Responsive Optimization - Ensure all sections work flawlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop

The project is a Next.js 16 portfolio with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. The design follows a cyberpunk "Tokyo at midnight" aesthetic with neon cyan, magenta, and green colors.
